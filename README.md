## Keypoints
+ Some of the scripts are taken from the internet (such as "SafeArea" or the "AutoSaveExtension")
+ Scripts path: Tester -> Assets -> Scripts

## About the project
- This is one of my first experiences with the Unity Engine, object-oriented programming (and programming in general)
- Extensive experimentation and the heavy learning process were involved
- The scripts are entirely written by me but the game design was developed in collaboration with @dug0ng0

The game is thought for android devices, but you can try an old web version at this link: [WIP]. 
Careful! In this version, the Limelien can be put on the serving dish after it has been cooked through the stove only!
