## About the project
- This is one of my first experiences with the Unity Engine, object-oriented programming (and programming in general).
- The code may not be of "professional-quality", due to the extensive experimentation and the heavy learning process involved.
- The scripts are entirely written by me and the game design was developed in collaboration with @dug0ng0.


The game is thought for android devices, but you can try an old web version at this link: [WIP].
